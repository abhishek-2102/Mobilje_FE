Avoid outdoor use and exposure to water or prolonged moisture.

Avoid exposure to direct heat or sunlight as this can cause the 
sofa colour to fade.

Keep sharp objects away from your sofa. A little tear on the fabric 
cover may be hard to repair.

If you have removable back cushions (or put extra cushions on your sofa), 
do reverse them periodically and fluff them up while arranging so that 
the cushion stays even.
